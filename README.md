MetPy is a Python script written by Adekunle Ibiyemi and Gillian Donaldson-Selby, James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen, Scotland, to read UK Met office (HAD-UK) data published in NetCDF format. All files should be in the same folder, and you will need to create a sub-folder called “Output_data”., as well as an Excel file containing the Easting and Northing (UK Grid) of the required site. 
In MetPy.py you will need to set a path to the folder and name of the Excel site file, a path to to the folder containing the NetCDF files, and a path to the sub-folder called “Output_data”. You will also need to change the variable for the required Met Office gridded data  - e.g. tasmin, tasmax, etc; and change the “MetOffice_data” flag as appropriate. The default setting is for Potential Evaporation.
